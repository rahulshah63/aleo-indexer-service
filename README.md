## ðŸ’¡ Aleo Money Market Indexer Example

This project serves as a practical example of how to utilize the `aleo-indexer` package. It showcases how to set up an indexer for a Aleo Money Market application.

To explore the example, understand its setup, and see the `aleo-indexer` in action, please visit the **[Aleo Money Market Indexer Example README](aleo-mm-indexer-example/README.md)**.

## Getting Started (Monorepo Level)

To set up the entire monorepo:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rahulshah63/Aleo-indexer.git](https://github.com/rahulshah63/Aleo-indexer.git)
    cd Aleo-indexer # Assuming this is your monorepo root name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    This will install dependencies for both `aleo-indexer` and `aleo-mm-indexer-example` due to the `workspaces` configuration in the root `package.json`.
